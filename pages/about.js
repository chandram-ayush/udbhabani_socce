            IIEST Shibpur (erstwhile BE college) was established in the year 1856. The Institute located at the bank of the Ganges, bestowed upon with a lush green and cheerful aura, is ranked 35th in NIRF rankings. An institute as old as time holds a rich and diverse history and was one of the pioneer institutes for engineering in India. Apart from diversities in its history, the institute has a versatile academic curriculum spanning from undergraduate to postgraduate courses equipped with academia determined to become engineers, scientists, entrepreneurs, and above all assets to society, supported by esteemed faculties in turning all the aspirations into realities, thus making a diverse network of alumni throughout the eras. This vast academic curriculum is rejuvenated by a bundle of co-curricular and extra-curricular activities provided by the various societies of the institute spanning from action-packed sports societies to strings of words airing in the literary societies and the fresh moves of reflexobeta, bounded together by the melodies of euphony. The spirit of science, tech, and culture is charged up by events and fests organized by the departments of the institute, and neither the department of civil engineering nor its academia fall short in boosting the same. The Department of Civil Engineering, the first step of this institute in this journey of immemorial steps, puts deliberate steps to make the journey filled with fun and learning and so is complemented by the Udbhabani, a Technical fest organized by the Society of Civil Engineers.
